* Error/residual
<!-- r_{i} = y_{i}-\hat{y}_{i} -->
* Least Sqaure
<!-- \sum_{i=1}^{n} r_{i}^{2} -->
* Mean Average Error(MAE)ï¼š 
* Mean Square Error(MSE)
<!-- \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} r_{i}^{2} -->
* Root Mean Sqaure Error(RMSE): It is also called residual standard deviation or the standard error of estimate. since it is actually the standard deviation of actual points around a fitted line. It meansures how much actual values are spread out around expected values. 

<!-- Standard error (SE) of a statistic is the approximate standard deviation of a statistical sample population.

Standard error is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of a statistics. -->






N(t) : Counting Process - the number of arrival at the end of time t
x_i: Inter-arrival time - the time between (i-1)-th and the i-th arrival 
s_i the time to the i-th arrival

Poisson Process - Poisson Distribution - Exponential Distribution - Gamma Distribution
