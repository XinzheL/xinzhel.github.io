# Introduction

Natural Language Understanding or NLP is definitely the essential puzzle of AI since various tasks could be figured out by computers if computers can understand human languages.  The first question comes to my head is: Why our human ability to learn a new language is extremely faster than so-far computers while we has been left far behind by computers in terms of numerical computations?  I think it needs us to discover what is the computer language.

## Human Languages vs Computer Language

Originally, the computer language just has two numbers: 0 and 1.  The context is extremely simple in the original computer language which could represent yes/no, positive/negative and so on. However, according to Chinese philosophy,  0/1 or Yin/Yang could generate and explain all the stuff. From this perspective, Chinese ancient people somehow foresaw the power of computers and the feasibility of making computers understand human languages.  The evolution of computer language has been proving this argument from low-level languages (e.g. machine code) to high-level languages(e.g. Java, Python) with natural language elements. However, all of these programming languages just have too abstract concepts to understand complicated contexts of natural languages like boolean logic, conditional logic, entity and so on.  



## Knowledge representation

Based on these basic concepts,  most of tasks requiring understanding natural language have been implemented by using knowledge representation. Often, natural language could be expressed by `First Order Logic` which gives power for making inference and reasoning in the knowledge base. Noticeably, all the semantics are stuffed into this logical structure and then need `semantic parsing` using `Abstract Syntax Tree` or `Context-Free Grammar`. Therefore, systems developed with this kind of approach are kind of rote learning. They are dull and inflexible because they do not understand the similarity among words.  For example, it could answer correctly with 'which countries Denmark border?'  while it could not understand "which countries Denmark edge?" . However,  this kind of approach work well for systems constructed in the specific field, e.g. CHAT-80 for geography.

 In contrast, This kind of approaches is top-down compared recently popular neural language understanding which does not depend on high-level logic representation. However, .
